# Reset Sharepoint CSS

## Description
This file resets the Core.css file in Sharepoint. Core.css has a bunch of random styles that interfered with prettier styles that were created by better people.

## Usage
Include this file in your masterpage (before or after your main theme styles).

````html
<link href="https://raw.github.com/kuatsure/Reset-Sharepoint-CSS/master/reset_sp.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
````

## Changelog
 * **1.0.0** Initial Release
 * **1.1.0** Cleaner and doesnâ€™t reset some values that are ok ( also added a few helpful comments )
 * **1.1.1** General updates ( adding some sharepoint driven classes to the mix )

### Author's Note
If you're using this reset, chances are you have a general reset anyways. But if you don't, might I suggest [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
